## Our Aims

GetPoplog is a small team that aims to automate the production and test of reliable, easy-to-use, simple installation methods for Poplog that deliver a well-organised and flexible installation.
- By reliable we mean that it copes with a wide variety of distributions without intervention
- By easy-to-use we mean that it uses well-established packaging mechanisms on our target platforms
- By simple we mean that users can immediately use it after installation without changing login scripts
- By well-organised we mean that its installed commands and environment-variables are few and well-grouped together
- By flexible we mean that advanced users can easily configure the full array of Poplog commands and linkage by environment variables.

Our wider goal is to make it easier for today's programmers to acquire and make good use of Poplog. So, as and when we feel that we have got installation under control, we will move onto the next two supporting areas: on-ramp learning materials and package management. 

This work is only possible thanks to [Aaron Sloman](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/aaron-sloman)'s dedication in maintaining the [FreePoplog](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html) resource over the years.
