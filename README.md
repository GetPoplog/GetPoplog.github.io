## Welcome to GetPoplog

### Our Aims

We aim to automate of the production and test of reliable, easy-to-use, simple installation methods for Poplog that deliver a well-organised but flexible installation.
- By reliable we mean that it copes with a wide variety of distributions without intervention
- By easy-to-use we mean that it uses well-established packaging mechanisms on our target platforms
- By simple we mean that users can immediately use it after installation without changing login scripts
- By well-organised we mean that its installed commands and environment-variables are few and well-grouped together
- By flexible we mean that advanced users can easily configure the full array of Poplog commands and linkage by environment variables.

This work is only possible thanks to [Aaron Sloman](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/aaron-sloman)'s dedication in maintaining
the [FreePoplog](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html) resource over the years.
